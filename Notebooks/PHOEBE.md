	- Bird Detection
		○ https://www.fierceelectronics.com/sensors/what-ir-sensor
		○ Research later if IR or Laser sensors might actually be better, since Ultrasonic Sensors may be inaccurate sometimes…
		 
		○ Motion/object detection (ToF sensors…?) -> microcontroller -> raspberry pi -> camera (captures photo) -> raspberry pi (image processing) -> microcontroller (controls) -> electrochromic glass + UV lights

# 2023-02-07

	- High Level Requirements
		○ The system can successfully detect when a bird is approaching or in close proximity
			§ Before passing the 1.37 meter mark, so maybe at 2 meters…?
		○ The system can turn the electrochromic panels opaque in response to bird detection
		○ The system can direct UV light in the 300-380 nm range at an approaching bird
	- 1 Subsystem Requirement
		○ Ultrasonic sensors (2 cm - 4 m range) will be able to locate the approximate location of the bird by using grid indices
	- Concerns: do flashing UV lights pose too great of a safety risk?
Might raise the stress level of birds and cause them to react differently than we want![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90936268/236611114-2d75bcd4-cf8d-4a50-8261-5f4b075185c2.png)

	- Took out part of the power system. We only need 4 MOSFET switches leading up to the electrochromic panel connectors now.
		○ Before:
			§ 
		○ After:
			§ We decided to switch the drivers we had with MOSFET switches, so the output pins of the ATMega32U4 connect the gates of the switching MOSFET, and the DC voltages we apply to the panels act as the loads

	- What's the difference between USBASP Programmer and ISP 6 Pin Programmer Header on the Design Document's components list?
I think we only need one of these two…![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90936268/236611665-35fa60cb-2393-4a16-b259-28107eb735a0.png)

# 2023-04-12

	- Raspberry Pi Power supply cancelled our request because it's out of stock, so I'm currently using my power bank for now
		○ Not sure if it's ok, because the board gets a bit warm…
		○ Check the supply shop
	- Trying to display thermal camera data on raspberry pi's monitor
		○ Change CS pin to pin 24
	- Finally solved all raspberry pi's + thermal camera's hook-up/software issues, and can access and display the thermal camera's data now!
	- 
	- ^ Using groupgets's LeptonModule GitHub repository, raspberrypi_video example (for working with the Raspberry Pi)
		○ Not exactly sure how the code (logic) works yet, but the output seems weird, and has an undesirable latency.
		○ Not sure what "Perform FFC" does

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90936268/236611721-0fc2d4df-cfb8-4b9d-9b43-ceea14806175.png)

# 2023-04-13

	- Helped out with making HC-SR04 Arduino code run faster (macros + order of function calls)
		○ Response time a bit too slow -  3.2 ms when we needed 2.75 ms
		○ Figure out how to use interrupts to make 6 tasks (one per ultrasonic sensor) run synchronously….
			§ Can potentially speed up everything, because putting everything in series and the delay functions take so much time…
			§ For one rising edge for echo interrupts, we simply read the time, and one more interrupt for the falling edge, and we get the duration
			§ We can have a new reading flag - if the flag is high, we calculate the distance + other stuff for object detection logic
	- Looked through LeptonModule source code
	- Looked into OpenCV for warm-blooded object classification
		○ Reading about the Sort Tracker - a multiple object tracker
			§ https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781789801811/10/ch10lvl1sec96/implementing-a-sort-tracker#:~:text=The%20Sort%20algorithm%20is%20a,box%20for%20each%20tracked%20object.

# 2023-04-14

	- HC-SR04 Arduino code
		○ Sequential reading of sensor data (removed some excess code) - 14 ms total

4/15/2023
	- Implementing interrupts might be overly complicated given the amount of time we have left for our project, assembly should happen first

4/18/2023
	- Installing v4l2loopback kernel module on raspberry pi
		○ https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=273788
	- Compiling v4i2loopback 
		○ https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback
		○ Could not solve "ERROR: modpost: "__aeabi_ldivmod" [/home/phoebec2/Desktop/ECE445/v4l2loopback/v4l2loopback.ko] undefined!"
			§ Tried finding the 64-bit division in v4l2loopback.cpp. Found divisions in lines 107, 449, 2309, 2329; still could not solve issue (through typecasting, commenting out, etc…)
	- Tried installing pylepton module instead (https://github.com/groupgets/pylepton)
		○ Encountered "OSError: [Errno 90] Message too long
			§ Solution: changed SPI buffer size
		○ There are two vertical white lines on my thermal image
		○ 
		○ https://hackaday.io/project/5359-pylepton-video-overlay
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90936268/236611776-64e4c2ee-f254-451d-80af-fd4e0abb5e66.png)

# 2023-04-24

	- Ultrasonic Sensors Progress
		○ While programming the ATMega32U4, it started burning…we did not order enough parts to try out our PCB design again…
	- Image Processing Progress
		○ Decided to simplify algorithm to just checking if the object is large/warm enough for each interrupt. We might not be able to do tracking, because there are issues with the output image where there are two random vertical white lines…finding/implementing another algorithm might be a bit too complicated given the time we have left.
			§ Solved! I just went through each row of the 60x80 pixel temperature-thresholded thermal image and set columns 43 and 78 to white if both of their left and right pixels are also white
		○ Contours after temperature-thresholding the input image (image pre-processing):
		○ 
		○ Included a size range for the blobs/contours - used bounding box dimensions
		○ 
		
		○ Since we cannot run our Controls Subsystem with the ATMega32U4 on our PCB, and we are using an Arduino Uno instead, we do not have enough pins to integrate the Controls Subsystem and Object Classification Subsystem together…
			§ Can use a button for the interrupt pin from the Controls to the Raspberry Pi
			§ Can use switches for the 4 pins from the Controls to the Raspberry Pi
Can use LEDs for the 4 pins from the Raspberry Pi to the Controls![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90936268/236611798-a8a5556d-bf42-433d-bbe3-1ef71d66dcae.png)

# 2023-04-25

	- The temperature thresholds for the thermal image processing need to be changed whenever we move the thermal camera to a new environment
		○ This means we would have to test/calibrate outputs of the thermal camera before using our bird-friendly window in a new environment
Should not take long, though![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90936268/236611813-36606303-f570-4b66-a202-9eaaefdc36e5.png)

# 2023-04-26

	- I am trying to read in thermal images, and outputting which glass blocks warm-blooded objects are at through LEDs. I am delaying for one second per frame read + processing for now. 
	- 
	- I am now trying to process the first thermal image, put a bounding box around my hand, and tracking my hand until it leaves the frame. 
		○ Warm object detected function
			§ Outputs
				□ Whether or not detected object is warm-blooded or not
					® Returns false if multiple warm-blooded objects/blobs are detected
				□ Bounding box
		○ Warm object tracking function
			§ CV2 tracker options: KCF, MedianFlow
	- Implemented the KCF tracker for my classified warm-blooded object, but encountered some data type issues with the images
	- Simply re-finding contours on input images during tracking and then making sure that only one contour is within our desired temperature and size range might actually be more time and space efficient than implementing the KCF!
		○ Re-finding Contours Method (L = 60, W = 80)
			§ O(L*W) for temperature thresholding
			§ O (L*W) for finding blobs/contours
			§ Maximum L*W contours (1 pixel contours), going through each contour to find only one within the acceptable size range O(1)
				□ I only put a minimum size limit right now, for easier testing with my hands
			§ Maximum L*W contour perimeter, going through each boundary point to see which 2x2 grid block it is in O(1)
			§ => O(L*W) per image
		○ KCF Method
			§ O(L*W) for temperature thresholding
			§ Updating tracker - larger runtime then O(L*W)
			§ We still have to find contours within the Region of Interest (ROI)/Bounding Box, and go through its perimeter to see which 2x2 grid block it intersects
	- Implemented tracking with the Re-finding Contours Method successfully. LEDs also respond with minimal latency! Very accurate LED outputs.
	- Changed the method of analyzing size of blob/contour
		○ Before: dimensions of its bounding box
		○ After: cv2.contourArea(blob)
	- Added a button for the interrupt. Successful functioning of logic!
